## Angular's future

Rob Eisenberg a former angular.js core developer:

> When AngularJS was first created, almost five years ago, it was not originally intended for developers. It was a tool targeted more at designers who needed to quickly build persistent HTML forms. Over time it has changed to accommodate a variety of scenarios and developers have picked it up and used it to build more and more complex applications. The Angular 1.x team has worked hard over the years to make incremental changes to the design, allowing it to continue to be relevant as the needs of modern web applications have changed. However, there are hard limits on the improvements that can be made, due to assumptions that were made as part of the original design. A number of these limits relate to performance problems resulting from the current binding and templating infrastructure. In order to fix those problems, new strategies are needed.

## Test Framework Karma

> Waiting for test results can be very distracting, as it can easily take more than a few minutes. Therefore developers tend to run the tests only several times a day, which makes it very difficult to debug possible test failures. The reason for that is simple - the more code the developer wrote since the last test run, the more space to look for the error...
